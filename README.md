# AuthServer
To ensure server owners and players the people on the game are actually those who they claim to be, this authentication server validates whether every user that connects to a server owns the account they want to play on.

If you want to have your own authentication server for whatever reason, [download the .zip](https://github.com/Cubition/AuthServer/archive/master.zip), import the [MySQL database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cubition/AuthServer/master/database.sql) and configure your system in `config.php`
